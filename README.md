Attempting to recreate an existing Shopify Store to get practice of Liquid Templating. 

The store I've chosen is: https://www.truefittandhill.ca/

The 2 elements I want to focus on re-creating are:
- Navigation Header
- Footer

For this first release I'm gonna skip past everything in the homepage.

The challenge currently in front of me is figuring out where the HTML and CSS styling elements go into.
