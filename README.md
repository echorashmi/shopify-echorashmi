Attempting to recreate an existing Shopify Store to get practice of Liquid Templating. 

The store I've chosen is: https://www.truefittandhill.ca/

The 2 elements I want to focus on re-creating are:
- Navigation Header
- Footer

For this first release I'm gonna skip past everything in the homepage.

The challenge currently in front of me is figuring out where the HTML and CSS styling elements go into and how do I get it on the browser. Step #1. 

Okay, got that sorted. Next up I want to get the top bar showing up - on the site it currently says "Free Shipping on Orders over $50" and has a icon as well. This is going to be interesting. 

In the Admin Panel I want to add a section that allows the admin to add an icon and the message. I'm not gonna use fonts at this point and the assumption is the text will print as is, no currency translations. 

Interesting.
